# Lone-Knight

Currently still in devleopment.  Controls are wither WASD or the arrow keys.  W/S move up and down respectively.  A/D move left to right respcetively.
Firing is with the mouse 1 button.  The game is powered by Unity 3D.

Currently all the assests are place holders.  My artist is currently working on the assests and almost has the player sprite completed.
