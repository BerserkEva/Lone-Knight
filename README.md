# Lone-Knight

Currently still in devleopment.  Controls are wither WASD or the arrow keys.  W/S move up and down respectively.  A/D move left to right respcetively.
Firing is with the mouse 1 button.  The game is powered by Unity 3D.

Currently all the assests are place holders.  My artist is currently working on the assests and almost has the player sprite completed.

The test branch is current development for Windows Phone 8.1 as well as other mobile devices.  Gamplay features will still be the same.  Character control will be touch screen, where you touch and drag the player character around the screen to move and firing will be included in the basic touch for the character movement.
